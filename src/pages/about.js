            <p>
              In 2000, Lynlee Altman started Maintenance Solutions, Incorporated,
              performing mostly exterior building maintenance and commercial renovations.
              As the company grew in size, Ms. Altman began pursuing larger
              construction projects, and changed the companyâ€™s name to reflect
              this expansion of the core services offered by Pinnacle Construction
              & Development Group.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under the 14 years of leadership of Ms. Altman, Pinnacle Construction
              has grown to a company that tackles some of the most challenging work
              including hazardous demolition and specialized construction requirements
              at NASA. Pinnacle Construction has grown from a small maintenance
              provider to a full service construction management company,
              delivering over $10 Million in construction projects annually.
