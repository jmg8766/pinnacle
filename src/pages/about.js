      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <StyledArticle>
        <p>
          In 2000, Lynlee Altman started Maintenance Solutions, Incorporated, performing mostly exterior building maintenance and commercial renovations. As the company grew in size, Ms. Altman began pursuing larger construction projects, and changed the companyâ€™s name to reflect this expansion of the core services offered by Pinnacle Construction & Development Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the 14 years of leadership of Ms. Altman, Pinnacle Construction has grown to a company that tackles some of the most challenging work including hazardous demolition and specialized construction requirements at NASA. Pinnacle Construction has grown from a small maintenance provider to a full service construction management company, delivering over $10 Million in construction projects annually.
